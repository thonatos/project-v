<h2>
  Hi there,
</h2>
<p>
  this is a basic <em>basic</em> example of <strong>Tiptap</strong>. Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you‚Äôd probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    That‚Äôs a bullet list with one ‚Ä¶
  </li>
  <li>
    ‚Ä¶ or two list items.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Isn‚Äôt that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there‚Äôs more. Let‚Äôs try a code block:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body { display: none; }</code></pre>
<p>
  I know, I know, this is impressive. It‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don‚Äôt forget to check the other examples too.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Wow, that‚Äôs amazing. Good work, boy! üëè
  <br />
