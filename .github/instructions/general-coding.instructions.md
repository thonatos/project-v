# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants (e.g., `REMIX_API`, `TZ_ASIA_SHANGHAI`)



## Code Quality
- Follow the project's Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commits
- Implement proper type definitions for all public APIs
- Use constants for magic numbers and strings
- Prefer explicit error handling over silent failures
